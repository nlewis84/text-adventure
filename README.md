# text-adventure

This is a text adventure that is a basic implementation of Call of Cthulhu 2nd Edition rules. I am using the story Alone Against the Dark by Matthew Costello as a framework. At this point, I know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am starting to feel comfortable with basics of JavaScript and wanted to try my hand at making something of my own.

v1.0 - Notes
Implemented 2 character sheets
Implemented die roll mechanics
Implemented skill check mechanics
Implemented character selection
Implemented game over detection via sanity and hit point loss
Implemented some minor styles
