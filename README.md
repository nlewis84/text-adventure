text-adventure is an JavaScript game that implements the story Alone Against the Dark by Matthew J. Costello.

This is a basic implementation of Call of Cthulhu 2nd Edition rules. I do not take credit for the substance of this story. At this point, I know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am starting to feel comfortable with basics of JavaScript and wanted to try my hand at making something on my own.
