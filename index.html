                For you, Professor Louis Grunewald, this first day of September, 1931, has been tiring and
                uncomfortable. Light mist has covered Arkham for most of the day. You held two uninspired undergraduate
                classes at Miskatonic University. You also met with the new chairman of the Literature Department, a
                giddy Technocrat. You survey your desk and see that a stack of papers to grade has already formed.
                You're enjoying your second pipe of the evening when the doorbell rings. To your surprise, it's a
                telegraphic messenger.</br></br>
                "It arrived at Kingspoint Head station not more than an hour ago,"the boy says. You sign for it, and
                slip a dime into the youngster's hand. "Oh, thank you, sir!" You open the envelope and scan the
                contents.</br></br>
                <strong>ATHENS, GREECE 9/1/31 via Kingspoint Station</br></br>
                    IN JAIL FOR ANTIQUITY THEFT STOP NEED HELP STOP CAN YOU COME STOP URGENT STOP SEE CORPORAL ILIONAS,
                    ATHENS BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION.</br></br>
                    GLIERE</strong></br></br>
                My goodness, you think. Imagine! Dotty old Gliere in prison! You recall that he had gone to Greece to
                work on his book concerning primitive myth. What has he gotten himself into? Should you wire money? You
                recall all the amusing discussions you've had with him, and a sudden insight lets you understand that
                Tibor Gliere had no close friends - except you. Should you go help him? You suppose the University will
                grant you leave. But, do you want to go?</br></br>
                With uncommon speed you decide to go to Athens to help Gliere. You write him a wire, and another to
                Ernest Holt, a wealthy New York financier and a good friend of yours. If you get into hot water, Holt
                will help. And you decide to keep him posted on your progress. You give both telegrams to the waiting
                messenger, along with the necessary fund.</br></br>
                What to do now? You have four dollars left in your waller - you'll go to the bank first thing in the
                morning. Trans-Atlantic schedules - the Advertiser surely carries that information. As you pack, you
                wonder if you should check Gliere's room at Mrs. Harding's boarding house. Maybe you could get a clue
                about Gliere's activities or a hint about his arrest.</br></br>
                Your passpost's in order; your clothes and sundries are packed. You'd best turn in. You're going on a
                little trip. When you awake, it is Sept. 2;
